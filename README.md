# Self-Making-Album

## Random notes

The idea here is to make a bunch of interelated scripts which will generate a musical album. In this repo, I'll make some sound engines to make noise. I'll also make some automated composition tools which will randomly be able to select from a a set of chord and melody generating algorithms.

If everything goes well, the script should be able to produce a complete album that is at least interesting to listen to. Using some random parameters, I think it'd be cool if you could generate basically a entirely new album everytime you run the script. 

I haven't decided yet if I'll build the system with a central seed so as to be able to reproduce an album. 

## Things that should be affected by randomness

- Name of the tracks
- The kind of sounds used
- The number of tracks
- The arrangement (number and types of instruments)
- The structure of the track (how many sections, what instruments are playing and that sort of thing)

I think I should not be too strict about this to be able to give rize to happy accidents.

## Audio Examples

So far the examples are very basic. This is mainly due to very rudimentary sound design and rythms. Here are some sound demos:
